= Objects

A file in Spin is called an _object_, and ends with the `.spin` extension.

An object can be written as the main program, or as a _library_ that can be used by other objects.

External objects are declared in an `OBJ` block, and given a unique alias.

----

 ser : "LameSerial"

Multiple copies of an object can be used.

----
 ser1 : "LameSerial"
 ser2 : "LameSerial"
----

Or an array of objects

----
 ser[4] : "LameSerial"

These can be accessed with brackets.

PUB Foo
