== Comments

Comments are text that are intended only for the programmer, and ignored by the compiler.

In Spin, Any text following an apostrophe (`'`) on a single line is is a comment, and ignored.

----

----

To span multiple lines, use curly braces (`{`,`}`).

}

=== Documentation Comments

If two apostrophes (`''`) or two curly braces (`{{`,`}}`) are used, the commented text becomes a documentation comment, and will appear in outputs generated by various Spin documentation tools.
