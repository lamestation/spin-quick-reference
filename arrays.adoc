== Arrays

Spin supports arrays, which store multiple variables as a unit. The size of the array must be declared in advance, with either an integer or a constant defined in a `CON` block.

----
VAR
 byte donuts[12]
 byte donuts[DOZEN]
----

You can access the values in arrays with `[]` notation.

----
x := donuts[4]
donuts[6] := 27
