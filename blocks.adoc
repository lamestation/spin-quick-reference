== Blocks

A feature unique to Spin is the use of _blocks_. Objects can contain six kinds of blocks: `CON`, `VAR`, `PUB`, `PRI`, `OBJ`, and `DAT`. Each block has its own syntax and allowed keywords, like little mini-languages of their own.

- *CONstant:* define values that cannot be changed.
- *VARiable:* define values that _can_ be changed.
- *PUBlic:* declare public functions.
- *PRIvate:* declare private functions.
- *OBJect:* include other objects for use by the current one.
- *DATa:* include arbitrary data in your object.
