=== Strings

A string is an array of bytes that is _null-terminated_, or ends in zero.

You can create strings on the fly and use them right away with the `string` keyword.

----
string("Hello world!")

Strings can also be declared in `DAT` blocks for reuse, then used with their address.

----
hellostring byte "Hello world!",0
